# Welcome to my Personal Business Website
Thanks for visiting my personal business website. It is a portfolio piece that demonstrates my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

## The Process
Before coding this business website, I designed a moodboard, style tiles, low and high-fidelity wireframes, and a prototype. The purpose was to create a good user experience, according to the target market research and personas.

This website has been created using Bootstrap. It was a new experience, as my previous projects were made using HTML, CSS, and Media Queries (for a responsive web design). 

## Challenges and Solutions
Since this was my first time using Bootstrap for a major project, I had to familiarize myself with the specific class names that were involved. Therefore, I paid close attention to the terminology that is used by Bootstrap, and I realized that there is a pattern (especially when it comes to the margins and padding). In the end, the project was completed successfully, and before the deadline.

## Conclusion
Through this process, I have realized that Bootstrap makes it easier to design a website. The framework is quite straightforward and useful. Moreover, there are a lot of customization options that can be utilized to create a unique and personalized theme for a website.
